Euphoric Brothers
uhhh so far its just the credits image the name of the game the bird and you know what screw it might as well include the drone but anyways yeah they are the reason for all of that go like wishlist garten of banban 26 or something
also now includes the banban guy and like the green fellas in one area and also like the uh like some of the textures that I made are based off of their characters lol
also includes the nabnab fella i guess also the banban fella appears on both the death screen and the battle intro so i feel like that should be mentioned too
most of the characters at this point are in here or are going to be and i dont feel like coming back to add more so just assume that most characters are used here
